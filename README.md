2025 Semester Project - Programming a animatronic eyes using serial communication from an Arduino to a .NET Framework
What the project will do: The animatronic eyes system will allow a user to control the movement of eyes through keyboard inputs. The eyes will be corolled by servos, which are managed by an Arduino. The C# application will handle user input and communicate with the Arduino to control the servos. The project will demonstrate both hardware and software integration.
